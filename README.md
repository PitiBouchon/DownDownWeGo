# === DownDownWeGo === #

2D infinite runner inspired by "Voyage au centre de la Terre" by Jules Verne.
The objective is to go as deep as you can without dying because of fall damage.
Constantly manage your falling speed to avoid going too fast and hurt yourself.

You can grab walls to slow down your descent, but be careful, you will quickly get
tired if you hold on for too long. Pay also attention to crackled stones, they 
will break as soon as you land on them !
